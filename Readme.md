# Reporting for Avalonia - Get Started

This example shows how to load a report from a file, configure the report to retrieve JSON data from a specified URL, and export the report to PDF.

## Implementation

The previously created report that uses JSON data from the https://northwind.netcore.io/customers.json location  is saved to a report layout file (*.repx).
If you are using VSCode Avalonia Extension to develop Avalonia-based apps, you can also install the [DevExpress Report Designer VSCode Extension](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/reporting/archive/2023/10/30/reporting-create-and-modify-devexpress-reports-in-vscode-on-macos-and-linux-ctp.aspx) to run the Report Wizard that enables you to create, edit, and save a report.

The report created earlier using JSON data from https://northwind.netcore.io/customers.json is saved to a report layout file (.repx ). If you're using the VSCode Avalonia Extension to develop Avalonia-based applications, consider installing the [DevExpress Report Designer VSCode Extension](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/reporting/archive/2023/10/30/reporting-create-and-modify-devexpress-reports-in-vscode-on-macos-and-linux-ctp.aspx). This extension allows you to run the Report Wizard and makes it easier to create, edit and save reports.


To open a report layout file (*.repx) at runtime, add it to the Avalonia `Assets` folder in the project.

Register a custom `IJsonSourceCustomizationService` service for the report instance to fetch JSON data dynamically. For Avalonia browser project, ensure to execute our native `JsonLoaderHelper.ConfigureHttpClient` and `JsonLoaderHelper.ConfigureHttpRequestMessage` methods at startup to pass credentials in the JSON data request.
